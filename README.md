### Summary of the project
Ghost is a wordgame that is played by two players. The players form a word by alternating turns saying a letter, which is added on the end of the word fragment. A player loses when he/she forms a word longer than 3 letters or creates a fragment which cannot become a wordt by adding more letters.
   
*(Ghost will be a native app for Android. The app will work with SDK API level 21.)*

### Features
- Write a custom username or pick a previously used one.
- Pick between Dutch or English dictionaries for the game.
- Guess a letter via an on-screen keyboard.
- Get notifications when you win/lose.
- Use a menu to restart game play or set language preferences.
- See your place in a high score list.
- Game state and preferences survive even when the app gets closed.
